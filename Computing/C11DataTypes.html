					<h1>Why we need Data Types</h1>
					<p>Different data types are stored an processed different ways by the computer and as the computer
					has no way of deciding what data type is being processed we need to tell it, so it can perform 
					the right processes to the data and can store the data correctly.</p>

					<h2>Representing Text</h2>
					<p>All data in a computer is represented by binary, 1s and 0s. There are many ways for us to 
					represent characters in this format, but for this data to be read by all computers there needs 
					to be a standard agreed upon set for representing characters, the original set was called ASCII.
					</p>
					<h3>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</h3>
					<p>In ASCII each character of the alphabet, numbers, symbols and control codes are represented 
					by an agreed upon binary patterns. The first iteration of ASCII used a single byte (8 bits), it 
					used 7 bits to represent the character and 1 bit as a parity bit, this allowed for the use of 
					128 different characters.</p>
					<img src="ComputingPictures/ComputingASCIITable.jpg" class="img-rounded imgHome">
					<p>The next Iteration of ASCII used all 8 bits to represent characters, this allowed the use of
					256 different characters. This new iteration is called Extended ASCII.</p>
					<img src="ComputingPictures/ComputingASCIIExtendedTable.jpg" class="img-rounded imgHome">
					<p>With only 8 bits to use you can only represent 256 characters, making it impossible to display 
					all of the worlds alphabets and symbols. This led to ASCII being replaced by Unicode. Unicode 
					originally only used 16 bits allowing 65536 characters. This 16 bit limitation was removed by 
					using a series of code pages, each page represents a chosen language. Because of this Unicode has
					no limits on how many characters there is.</p>

					<h2>Boolean Data</h2>
					<p>Boolean is a data type that can only take one of two values, True or False using 1 for True and 
					0 for False. Boolean data only requires one bit to store a value but it normally uses an entire byte
					for convenience. Boolean data is used to flag if an event has occured.</p>

						<p>Binary is a number system based on 2. The column values are the powers of 2 starting at 2<sup>0</sup></p>
						<p>Denary is the number system we use on an everyday basis and is based on 10. The column values

						<p>Integers are represented in binary using powers of 2. We add up the column value where there is 
						a 1 in the binary number to get the denary equivalent.</p>
						<p>To convert from denary to binary, you divide by 2 repeatedly and write down the remainder at each

					<h2>Representing Negative Integers in Binary</h2>
					<p>There are tow ways to represent negative integers in binary.</p>
					<h3>Sign and Magnitude</h3>
					<p>Sign and magnitude works like the denary convention of representing negative integers by putting a + infront 
					for positive and - for negative. However in sign and magnitude the sign takes up the Most Significant Bit.
					This Most Significant Bit becomes the sign bit. To store the sign as a binary value it is 0 for + and 1 for -.</p>

					<h2>Representing Numbers in Hexadecimal</h2>
					<p>Hexadecimal is another number system with a base of 16. Computers do not work in hexadecimal but it is 
					often used to represent numbers stored in a computer because it is simpler for humans to read and
					remember. This is because it gives us a direct representation of binary since the base value 
					16=2<sup>4</sup> or four bits a nibble. This means 8 bits is represented by 2 hex columns, 
					this makes it easier to remember as 2 digits is easier to remember than 8 1s and 0s. One 
					problem with hex is that we only have the digits 0-9 when we need 16 so we are missing 5 
					digits, to make up these missing five we use A-F.</p>

					<h2>Representing Images in Binary</h2>
					<p>A simple black and white image is made up of black an white dots. The character can be represented 
					in binary by simply choosing 1 for black and 0 for white. Real images are more complex than black and
					white, they have several colours that need to be represented. In a single bit you can only represent 
					only 2 colours. For more colours you use more bits. 2 bits can represent 4 colours, 3 bits can represent 
					8 colours, 8 bits can represent 256 colours and 16 bits can represent 65536 colours.</p>
					<p>The information about the image is stored in Metadata. Metadata includes information about the number 
					of bits per pixel, colour depth, resolution of the image in dots per inch and height and width in pixels.
					Image files come in 2 major formats, one of these is a set of pixels in bitmap form, the other is a vector 
					form. In vector graphics, format images are made up of primitive shapes and with other information about the 
					shape, including a set of control points the shape must pass through.</p>
					<p>When enlarged bitmap image becomes pixelated, the pixels become larger and more visable and we can 
					see the blocks that make up the image. This is not a problem with vector graphics as the infromation that 
					makes up the shapes is recalculated and the primitive shapes redrawn. Because of this a larger bitmap image 
					with a high resolution takes more data to store and is linked to the size and resolution of the image.</p>
